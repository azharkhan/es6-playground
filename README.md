# ES6 Playground

A quick playground to serve up a web browser using **Webpack** and **Webpack Dev Server** that compiles ES6 code using the `babel-loader`.

### Setup & Instructions

* `npm install` - setup development environment
* create any files in the `src/` folder
* open up `src/index.js` and import the file you'd like to run
* `npm start` to run the server
* If you need dummy data, there's some data in `src/data.js` for you to play with, or create your own!

### Future Extensions

1. Adding linting support via `eslint`
